It also means accounting for varying device capabilities and network conditions. True accessibility goes beyond screen readers and alt text; it's about creating products that are intuitive, resilient, and respectful of the user's context.\n\nThis post outlines a framework for inclusive design that we follow at The Nairobi Tech Creative. We'll cover topics like offline-first architecture, performance optimization for low-end devices, localization best practices, and the importance of user research with diverse community groups. By prioritizing accessibility from day one, we can build products that truly serve everyone.",
