# **App Name**: Nairobi Tech Creative Hub

## Core Features:

- 2025 Innovation Suite Showcase: Display the six apps (Inventory Management, Graphic Design Workbench, Financial Management Tool, LMS, and 2 Enterprise Web Platforms) with descriptions and key features within an interactive portfolio grid.
- 90-Day Startup Conversion Timeline: Visualize the 90-day journey from concept to revenue using a scroll-linked animation, illustrating the milestones achieved by the two startups.
- Dynamic 'Stamp' Logo: Implement an SVG logo of a tribal-patterned handprint ('The Stamp') with Framer Motion path animations to create an engaging brand symbol.
- Background Texture Generator: Generate a subtle tribal pattern that subtly appears in the background of the site.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Zinc (#18181b) for the background, providing a modern, neutral base.
- Accent color: Orange (#f97316) used for interactive elements and highlights, reflecting energy and innovation. Ensure sufficient contrast against the Zinc background.
- Secondary color: Yellow (#eab308) to accent calls to action and key information, providing a warm contrast. Verify accessible contrast ratios.
- Body and headline font: 'Poppins', a clean, modern sans-serif, to maintain readability and align with the contemporary brand aesthetic.
- Implement a Bento Grid layout using Shadcn UI for the project portfolio to showcase the '2025 Innovation Suite' effectively.
- Use Framer Motion for smooth transitions and animations throughout the site, enhancing user experience without being intrusive.
- Incorporate simple, geometric icons that complement the 'Poppins' typography. The fill color of icons may be orange or yellow to highlight or to provide a strong affordance.
